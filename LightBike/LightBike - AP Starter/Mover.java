 * A Mover is an actor that also has 'move', 'canSee', 'destroy' and 'atWorldEdge' ability.

 * it is currently facing.
 * 
 * The 'Mover' class is a subclass of Actor. It can be used by creating subclasses, or
 * copied into scenarios and edited inline.
 * 
 * The initial direction is to the right. Thus, this class works best with images that

 * 
 * This class can also check whether we are close to the edge of the world.
